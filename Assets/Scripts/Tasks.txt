1. Create Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra Device Simulator
	-https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.device-simulator@3.0/manual/DefiningCustomDevices.html

2. Investigate using multiple colliders for gameObjects
	- Useful for distinguishing "touch" vs "point" triggers
	- May need to add border colliders on conveyor object or screenspace
		- I want the Movable objects when they're not on the conveyor to be deleted.
			- Not sure if I want it deleted immediately, or over time (5 second rule or something?)

3. Set up a Trello board
    - Separate bugs, tasks, and stories
    - Delete the text files
